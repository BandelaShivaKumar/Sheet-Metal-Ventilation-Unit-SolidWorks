![Model Screenshot](Screenshot%202025-05-27%20213107.png)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a 3D **Sheet Metal Ventilation Unit** created using **SolidWorks 2025** as part of my mechanical design portfolio. It is designed using the Sheet Metal module, suitable for HVAC applications.

The model showcases fundamental sheet metal techniques such as base flanges, edge flanges, cutouts, and vents. The top panel features a circular vent design typically used for air circulation or cooling components.

## ✨ Key Features

- Sheet Metal Base and Edge Flanges
- Custom Vent Pattern using Cut-Extrude
- Fabrication-ready flat pattern generation
- Material thickness and bend parameters applied
- Optimized for manufacturing simulation

---

## 📂 File Structure

- `Ventilation_Unit.SLDPRT` – Main SolidWorks part file
- `FlatPattern.DXF` – Fabrication-ready drawing (optional)
- `Screenshot 2025-05-27 213107.png` – Model image

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `Ventilation_Unit.SLDPRT` in **SolidWorks 2020 or later**.
2. Click on **Sheet Metal > Flatten** to view the flat pattern.
3. You can export the flat pattern to DXF for manufacturing if required.
4. Review vent cutouts and analyze flange design under **FeatureManager**.
